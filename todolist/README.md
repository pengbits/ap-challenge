# Todo List

This is a simple Todo list app that was created with React. I have added the following functionality:

## Create a task
To add a new task, enter some text ie 'Go to the store' in the text input and click on the "Submit" button. (Or hit enter to submit the form).

## Delete a task
Click on the "Delete" button next to the task description to delete it, removing the item from the list

## Toggle completed state
Click on the checkbox directly in front of the task description to set it's complete state on or off. 

## Sort Todos by Completed
Todos are sorted by completed or uncompleted state, with completed tasks appearing at the end of the list

## Get started. 
This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app. It assumes a working node/npm environment. To run the app, do the following:

```
cd todolist
npm install # get dependencies....
...
...
npm run start
```

This will start the app running on 3000 locally.
