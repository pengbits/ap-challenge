## Diagonal Matrix Sum
Medium Difficulty: (Do it in a single loop)


Given a 2D square matrix, find the sum of elements in Principal and Secondary diagonals. For example, consider the following 3 X 3 input matrix. 


Input: [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] 
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

output:
Principal Diagonal: 15
Secondary Diagonal: 15
